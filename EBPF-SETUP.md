# eBPF Setup Guide

## ⚠️ "eBPF compilation failed (needs kernel headers)"

**This is EXPECTED and OK!** You can continue development without eBPF for now.

## 🤔 What Does This Mean?

The setup script tried to compile eBPF programs but couldn't because:
- Kernel headers are not installed
- Or kernel version is too old (need 5.8+)
- Or you're not on a Linux system

## ✅ Do You Need eBPF Right Now?

**NO!** You can develop and test the 5G network without eBPF tracing:

- ✅ All network functions work without eBPF
- ✅ You still get application-level tracing (OpenTelemetry)
- ✅ You still get metrics (Victoria Metrics)
- ✅ You still get logs (structured logging)
- ✅ WebUI works fine
- ✅ Everything builds and runs

**eBPF adds:** Kernel-level tracing with trace context propagation (advanced observability)

## 🔧 When to Install eBPF Support

Install eBPF support when you want:
- Kernel-level performance tracing
- Network packet tracing
- Low-level system observability
- W3C trace context at kernel level
- Production-grade distributed tracing

## 📋 How to Install eBPF Support (Optional)

### Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y \
    clang \
    llvm \
    libbpf-dev \
    linux-headers-$(uname -r) \
    bpftool \
    make \
    pkg-config
```

### Fedora/RHEL
```bash
sudo dnf install -y \
    clang \
    llvm \
    libbpf-devel \
    kernel-devel \
    bpftool \
    make \
    pkg-config
```

### After Installation
```bash
# Check kernel version (need 5.8+)
uname -r

# Verify clang is installed
clang --version

# Try compiling again
cd observability/ebpf
make clean
make all

# Should see: ✓ eBPF programs compiled successfully
```

## 🐧 System Requirements for eBPF

| Requirement | Minimum | Recommended |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| OS | Linux | Linux |
| Kernel | 5.8+ | 5.15+ |
| Clang | 10+ | 15+ |
| LLVM | 10+ | 15+ |

### Check Your System
```bash
# Check kernel version
uname -r

# Check if BPF is enabled
ls /sys/fs/bpf/

# Check BTF support
ls /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux

# Check clang
clang --version
```

## 🚀 Development Without eBPF

You can fully develop the 5G network without eBPF:

### What Works
```bash
# Build all network functions
make build

# Run tests
make test

# Deploy to Kubernetes
make deploy-all

# Use WebUI
npm run dev:webui

# Get application traces
# (OpenTelemetry at application level)
```

### What You'll Miss
- Kernel-level tracing
- Automatic trace context propagation
- Network packet inspection
- Low-level performance metrics

**But:** You still get comprehensive observability with:
- Application-level OpenTelemetry traces
- Victoria Metrics
- Structured logging
- Grafana dashboards

## 📊 Observability Options

### Without eBPF (Current)
```
Application Code
      ↓
OpenTelemetry SDK
      ↓
OTLP Collector
      ↓
Tempo/Jaeger
```

### With eBPF (After Setup)
```
Kernel (eBPF hooks)
      ↓
eBPF Programs
      ↓
OpenTelemetry SDK  ← Trace context propagated
      ↓
OTLP Collector
      ↓
Tempo/Jaeger
```

## 🔄 Migration Path

The code is designed for easy eBPF migration:

### Phase 1: Now (Simulated)
- Application-level tracing
- Manual instrumentation
- Works everywhere

### Phase 2: Later (eBPF)
- Install kernel headers
- Compile eBPF programs
- Enable eBPF tracer
- Zero code changes needed!

## 🎯 Quick Decision Guide

### Skip eBPF For Now If:
- ✅ You're just exploring the code
- ✅ You're on a VM without kernel headers
- ✅ You want to start developing quickly
- ✅ You're not doing production performance analysis

### Install eBPF If:
- ⚡ You want kernel-level tracing
- ⚡ You're doing performance optimization
- ⚡ You want the full observability stack
- ⚡ You're deploying to production

## 📝 Summary

**Current Status:** ✅ Everything works except eBPF compilation

**Impact:** ⚠️ Low - Application-level tracing still works

**Action Required:** 🔵 Optional - Install only if you need kernel tracing

**Can Continue?:** ✅ YES! Keep developing normally

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

```bash
# Continue setup (eBPF compilation is optional)
./scripts/setup-dev-env.sh

# Or skip to development
make build
npm run dev:webui

# Install eBPF later when needed
# (Just run the apt-get/dnf commands above)
```

**Don't let this warning stop you!** The 5G network works great without eBPF tracing. 🎉
