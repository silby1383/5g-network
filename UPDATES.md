# Project Updates - Simulated Implementation

## Changes Made

The project has been updated to use **simulated implementations** for the data plane and radio interface, making initial development faster and more practical while maintaining a clear migration path to production-grade performance.

## Key Changes

### 1. **UPF Data Plane** â†’ Simulated in Go

**Before:**
- eBPF/XDP-based high-performance data plane
- Complex kernel programming required
- Target: 10+ Gbps throughput

**After:**
- Simulated data plane implemented in Go
- Focus on PFCP protocol compliance and correctness
- Clean `DataPlane` interface for future eBPF/XDP swap
- Simulated GTP-U encapsulation/decapsulation
- Simulated QoS enforcement
- Performance targets relaxed for initial phase

**Benefits:**
- âœ… Faster development (no eBPF learning curve)
- âœ… Easier debugging (standard Go tools)
- âœ… Full control plane testing without hardware
- âœ… Clean interfaces allow future upgrade to eBPF/XDP

- âœ… Open interfaces enable multi-vendor scenarios

### 3. **Observability** â†’ OpenTelemetry First, eBPF Optional

**After:**
- **OpenTelemetry-based distributed tracing**

| SMF | Sessions/sec | 500 |
| UPF | Focus | Correctness |
| UDM | Query latency | <10ms |
| **Goal** | **Validation** | **Control plane** |

### Production Mode (Optional Future Upgrade)
| Component | Metric | Target |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| AMF | Registrations/sec | 10,000 |
| SMF | Sessions/sec | 5,000 |
| UPF | Throughput | 10+ Gbps |

## What Stays The Same

- âœ… **All other Network Functions** (AMF, SMF, AUSF, UDM, UDR, PCF, NRF, NSSF, NEF, NWDAF) - no changes
- âœ… **ClickHouse** for subscriber data - same implementation
- âœ… **Victoria Metrics** for time-series metrics - same implementation
- âœ… **3GPP Compliance** - all protocols still compliant
- âœ… **Kubernetes deployment** - same orchestration approach
- âœ… **WebUI** - same management interface
- âœ… **Multi-agent development** - same 12-agent structure
- âœ… **48-week timeline** - same overall duration

## Migration Path to Production

When you're ready for production-grade performance:

### UPF Upgrade
```go
// 1. Keep existing PFCP server and interfaces
// 2. Swap out simulated data plane

// Before:
dp := simulated.NewSimulatedDataPlane()

// After:
dp := ebpf.NewEBPFDataPlane()

// 3. All other code remains the same (PFCP, GTP-U tunnel mgmt, etc.)
```

### Radio Upgrade
- Replace simulated O-RU with real hardware (e.g., Benetel, Foxconn O-RU)
- Replace channel simulator with actual RF
- Keep all interfaces (E2, A1, F1) unchanged
- RIC xApps and rApps continue to work as-is

### Observability Upgrade
- Add eBPF programs alongside OpenTelemetry
- Kernel-level visibility complements application tracing
- No changes to existing OTEL instrumentation
