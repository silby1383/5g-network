# Kernel Headers Issue - Incomplete Installation

## Problem

Your kernel (`6.12.41+deb13-amd64`) has incomplete header files installed. The headers are missing:
- `asm/bitsperlong.h`
- `asm/types.h`
- Other architecture-specific files

This is common with:
- Custom kernels
- Minimal kernel installations
- Some Debian derivatives

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Use Application-Level Tracing (Recommended)

**The 5G network works perfectly without eBPF!**

You still get comprehensive observability:
- ✅ OpenTelemetry traces at application level
- ✅ Victoria Metrics
- ✅ Structured logging
- ✅ Grafana dashboards
- ✅ Distributed tracing

```bash
# Just continue development without eBPF
make build
npm run dev:webui
```

### Option 2: Install Full Kernel Source

If you really need eBPF, install full kernel source:

```bash
# Get kernel source
sudo apt-get install linux-source-$(uname -r | cut -d'-' -f1)

# Extract source
cd /usr/src
sudo tar xjf linux-source-*.tar.bz2

# Create symlink
sudo ln -s /usr/src/linux-source-*/ /usr/src/linux
```

### Option 3: Use Pre-built eBPF (Future)

We can provide pre-compiled eBPF objects that don't need compilation.

### Option 4: Use Different Kernel

Switch to a standard kernel with full headers:

```bash
# Install standard kernel
sudo apt-get install linux-image-amd64 linux-headers-amd64

# Reboot into standard kernel
sudo reboot
```

## Current Status

✅ **Everything works except eBPF compilation**

- Network functions: ✓
- WebUI: ✓  
- Application tracing: ✓
- Metrics: ✓
- Logging: ✓

⚠️ **eBPF compilation fails**

- Kernel-level tracing: ✗ (optional feature)

## Impact Assessment

**Low Impact** - eBPF is an advanced feature for production optimization.

For development and testing, application-level observability is sufficient.

## Recommendation

**For now:** Continue without eBPF. Focus on implementing network functions.

**Later:** When deploying to production, use a standard Linux kernel with full headers support.

## What eBPF Provides (That You're Missing)

- Kernel-level HTTP tracing
- Automatic trace context propagation
- Network packet inspection
- Zero application overhead

## What You Still Have (Application-Level)

- OpenTelemetry SDK tracing
- Manual trace context propagation
- Application-level metrics
- Structured logging

**The main difference:** Tracing happens in your application code instead of the kernel.

## Technical Details

Your kernel headers installation:
```
/usr/src/linux-headers-6.12.41+deb13-amd64/
├── include/
│   ├── config/      ✓ Present
│   └── generated/   ✓ Present
├── include/linux/   ✗ Missing (incomplete)
├── arch/x86/        ✗ Missing (incomplete)
└── asm/             ✗ Missing
```

A complete installation should have:
```
/usr/src/linux-headers-*/
├── include/
│   ├── linux/       ✓ Full Linux headers
│   ├── asm-generic/ ✓ Generic ASM headers
│   └── uapi/        ✓ User API headers
├── arch/x86/include/
│   ├── asm/         ✓ x86-specific headers
│   └── uapi/        ✓ x86 user API
└── scripts/         ✓ Build scripts
```

## Bottom Line

Don't worry about this! The 5G network works great without eBPF.

Continue development and add eBPF later when you have a production kernel.
